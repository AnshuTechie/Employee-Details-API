# Employee-Details-API

The Employee Details API project was developed to streamline employee data management by providing a scalable and secure RESTful API. The primary objective was to replace manual record-keeping with an automated system that enables efficient Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. By implementing a structured backend solution, the project aimed to solve the common problem of disorganized employee records and inefficient data retrieval in organizations.

To execute the project, Spring Boot was used as the backend framework, leveraging Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) for efficient database interactions and MySQL/PostgreSQL for structured data storage. The API was designed following RESTful principles, ensuring seamless integration with frontend applications. JWT authentication was implemented to enhance security, protecting sensitive employee information. JUnit and Mockito were used for unit testing, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the API. Additionally, Postman was used for testing the endpoints, and GitHub was utilized for version control and code management.

As an individual project, I was responsible for the entire development lifecycle, from designing the database schema and implementing RESTful API endpoints to handling error management, validation, and optimizing database queries. I also ensured that the API followed best practices in terms of performance, scalability, and security.

The project resulted in a well-structured and efficient employee management system, significantly improving data organization and reducing manual efforts in managing records. With secure authentication in place, the system provided controlled access to employee data, ensuring data privacy. The successful implementation of this API strengthened my expertise in backend development, API security, and database optimization, making it a valuable learning experience.
